### System requirements

Dart SDK Version 2.18.0 or greater.
Flutter SDK Version 3.3.0 or greater.

### Figma design guidelines for better UI accuracy

Read our guidelines to increase the accuracy of design-to-code conversion by optimizing Figma designs.
https://docs.dhiwise.com/docs/Designguidelines/intro

### Check the UI of the entire app

Check the UI of all the app screens from a single place by setting up the 'initialRoute'Â Â to AppNavigation in the AppRoutes.dart file.

### Facebook authentication configuration

Steps:
- Follow the steps on https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_login_facebook for Facebook login and only update app_id and client_token in your project.
- For Android:
    - Update facebook_app_id and facebook_client_token in /android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml  file.
- For iOS:
    - ConfigureÂ Info.plistÂ (ios/Runner/Info.plist) file and update APP_ID and CLIENT_TOKEN.

### Google authentication configuration

Steps:
- Follow the steps on https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in for Google sign-in.
- For iOS:
    - Download the GoogleService-Info.plist  file. Drag and drop the downloaded file into the Runner subfolder and update Info.plist  file.
